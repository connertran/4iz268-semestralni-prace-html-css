            The problem we see right now is that now AI language models work very
            well with high resource languages, such as English, Spanish, Chinese,
            etc. But for low resource languages, such as Swahili, Vietnamese, and
            other unpopular languages in Asia, Africa or in other countries, AI
            language models don't work well, and still need rooms for improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact is AI now can work with 100+ languages. However, we have more
            than 7000 languages, which mean many people, who don't speak high
            resource languages, like English are left behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don't want anyone to be left behind, and we see other companies are
            trying to improve AI language models for high language model even
            more, and haven't focused in this area yet. Therefore, we decided to
            tackle in this area and to be one of the pioneers in this area.
          </p>
          <p>
            At OneNine, we do not train AI models, but we collect data from
            different low-resource languages, and then we provide/supply the
            prepared/labeled data to big AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google,
            Meta, etc.

            Back in the days, I was a WordPress freelancer. I didn't have much
            experience with fullstack development, building frontend and backend
            for a application. I decided to learn WordPress to build static
            landing pages for different businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            After spending a few months on Youtube tutorials and online courses. I
            started to find clients on different freelancing platforms,
            forexample: Upwork, Fiverr, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my clients was a business called Odyserve. They were a video
            editing business. They wanted to build a landing page for their
            business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only did I build the landing page for them, but I also helped them
            build about page, services page, and contact page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a WordPress freelancer was a great experience. I learned a lot
            about how to build static pages for different businesses, and work
            with customers. However, I knew that I wanted to do more than just
            building static pages. Therefore, I made a hard decision to leave my
            comfort zone and to learn different skills and technologies to become
            a fullstack developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please review the pages that I created for Odyserve. How would you
            rate my work?

            Back in the days, I wanted to scale my personal brand on X (a.k.a.
            Twitter). However, I found that is was challenging to come up with new
            ideas and post them on the platform, because in order to grow your
            folowers you need to be active on X.
          </p>
          <p>
            I asked myself: "With all my fullstack skills, how can I build a
            software that can solve my own problem? Hmm..., what about other
            people, who also have the similar problem like me? Struggling to
            manage their time in a day to be active on X? Let's build a SaaS
            business..."
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, I dived into the idea and built Flowy, a software that
            helps people generate new ideas for posts powered by AI. The
            application also provides users with automatic posting feature. That
            means, users can focus on their business, and let the software handle
            from generating content to posting them on X for them daily, or based
            on their schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am so greatful, that people are using my product. What makes me even
            more happy is. Users often require new features or updates. This means
            that my product has a big impact on their daily workflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you also have the similar problem like us, trying to grow on X, but
            struggle to find the right time in a day to do it. Please check out
            Flowy. I hope it will make your life easier.
