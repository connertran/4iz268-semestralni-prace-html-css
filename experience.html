              OneNine company is my startup company that me and my co-founder
              founded in 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem we see right now is that now AI language models work
              very well with high resource languages, such as English, Spanish,
              Chinese, etc. But for low resource languages, such as Swahili,
              Vietnamese, and other unpopular languages in Asia, Africa or in
              other countries, AI language models don't work well, and still
              need rooms for improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fact is AI now can work with 100+ languages. However, we have
              more than 7000 languages, which mean many people, who don't speak
              high resource languages, like English are left behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don't want anyone to be left behind, and we see other companies
              are trying to improve AI language models for high language model
              even more, and haven't focused in this area yet. Therefore, we
              decided to tackle in this area and to be one of the pioneers in
              this area.
            </p>
            <p>
              At OneNine, we do not train AI models, but we collect data from
              different low-resource languages, and then we provide/supply the
              prepared/labeled data to big AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google,
              Meta, etc.

              Back in the days, I was a WordPress freelancer. I didn't have much
              experience with fullstack development, building frontend and
              backend for a application. I decided to learn WordPress to build
              static landing pages for different businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              After spending a few months on Youtube tutorials and online
              courses. I started to find clients on different freelancing
              platforms, forexample: Upwork, Fiverr, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my clients was a business called Odyserve. They were a
              video editing business. They wanted to build a landing page for
              their business.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only did I build the landing page for them, but I also helped
              them build about page, services page, and contact page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a WordPress freelancer was a great experience. I learned a
              lot about how to build static pages for different businesses, and
              work with customers. However, I knew that I wanted to do more than
              just building static pages. Therefore, I made a hard decision to
              leave my comfort zone and to learn different skills and
              technologies to become a fullstack developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please review the pages that I created for Odyserve. How would you
              rate my work?

            <p>
              Back in the days, I wanted to scale my personal brand on X (a.k.a.
              Twitter). However, I found that is was challenging to come up with
              new ideas and post them on the platform, because in order to grow
              your folowers you need to be active on X.
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked myself: "With all my fullstack skills, how can I build a
              software that can solve my own problem? Hmm..., what about other
              people, who also have the similar problem like me? Struggling to
              manage their time in a day to be active on X? Let's build a SaaS
              business..."
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, I dived into the idea and built Flowy, a software that
              helps people generate new ideas for posts powered by AI. The
              application also provides users with automatic posting feature.
              That means, users can focus on their business, and let the
              software handle from generating content to posting them on X for
              them daily, or based on their schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am so greatful, that people are using my product. What makes me
              even more happy is. Users often require new features or updates.
              This means that my product has a big impact on their daily
              workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you also have the similar problem like us, trying to grow on X,
              but struggle to find the right time in a day to do it. Please
              check out Flowy. I hope it will make your life easier.
