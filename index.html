          into computer games. So, I decided to study Computer Science and
          become a software developer, because I want to know how computer works
          behind the scenes. And see if I can build anything helpful for people
          in the future, if try try my best to learn and practice skills to do
          that.

          projects for different entrepreneurs to gain my experience in the
          field of software engineering.
