      <h2>Software Engineer Tutoring</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Besides, trying to build helpful software solutions for different
          app-users, I also love to help others to become a real software
          engineer, not just how to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see many people, who want to become a developer, but they don't know
          where to start or how to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, I decided to start a tutoring journey and help people to
          become a software developer, from zero to hero. That means, after
          learning with me, they should have a few real-worlds projects and a
          strong LinkedIn profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested in learning from me, please book a consultation
          with me.
